# PresencePulse ðŸŸ¢

**PresencePulse** is a lightweight GNOME desktop app that keeps your Microsoft Teams status active by launching a dedicated Chromium session and simulating periodic activity. Designed for Linux environments (especially NixOS), it avoids synthetic input detection and integrates cleanly with your desktop.
